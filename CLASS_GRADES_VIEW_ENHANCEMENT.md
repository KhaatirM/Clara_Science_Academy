## Bug Fix 1: Group Assignments Missing in Grades View

### Problem
When School Administrators/Directors navigated to a class's grades view, they could see both individual student assignments and group assignments in the main class view, but when clicking "View Grades", only individual assignments were displayed. Group assignments were completely missing from the grades table.

### Root Cause
The `class_grades` route in `managementroutes.py` was only querying for `Assignment` objects and not including `GroupAssignment` objects.

### Solution
Updated the `class_grades` route to:
1. Query both individual assignments and group assignments
2. Process group grades by checking which students belong to which groups
3. Link group grades to students through their group membership
4. Display both types of assignments in the grades table with visual distinction

### Files Modified
- **managementroutes.py** (lines 1800-1942)
  - Added group assignments query
  - Added logic to fetch group grades for students
  - Included group assignment handling with special key format: `group_{assignment_id}`
  - Updated template context to include `group_assignments` and `all_assignments`

- **templates/management/class_grades.html**
  - Updated assignment count display to show total, individual, and group counts
  - Modified table headers to display both individual and group assignments
  - Added badges to distinguish Individual (blue) vs Group (teal) assignments
  - Group assignment grades show group name on hover

## Feature Addition: Student Grades View

### Requirement
Added a toggle button to switch between two view modes:
1. **Assignments & Grades Table** - Traditional table view showing all assignments and grades
2. **Student Grades View** - Card-based layout showing each student with their current grade and last 3 assigned assignments

### Implementation

#### View Mode Toggle
- Added a button group at the top of the page to switch between views
- Uses URL parameter `?view=table` or `?view=student_cards`
- Default view is `table`

#### Student Cards View Features
Each student card displays:
- **Student Name and ID** - Prominent header with icon
- **Class Name** - Shows which class this is for
- **Grade Level** - Badge showing student's current grade level
- **Current Average** - Highlighted with color coding:
  - Green: 90% and above
  - Blue: 80-89%
  - Yellow: 70-79%
  - Red: Below 70%
  - Gray: N/A (no grades yet)
- **Last 3 Assignments** - Shows:
  - Assignment title (truncated if too long)
  - Assignment type badge (Individual or Group)
  - Due date
  - Grade with color coding
- **View Details** - Button to navigate to full student profile

#### Card Layout
- Responsive grid: 3 columns on large screens, 2 on medium, 1 on mobile
- Cards have consistent height for clean appearance
- Gradient header for visual appeal
- Hover effects for interactivity

### Files Modified
- **managementroutes.py** (lines 1800-1942)
  - Added `view_mode` parameter handling
  - Added logic to prepare `recent_assignments` for card view
  - Sorts assignments by due date to get the 3 most recent

- **templates/management/class_grades.html**
  - Added view toggle button group
  - Wrapped table view in conditional `{% if view_mode == 'table' %}`
  - Added complete student cards view in `{% else %}` block
  - Implemented card layout with Bootstrap grid
  - Added styling for gradients and card effects

## Technical Details

### Group Grades Data Structure
Group assignments are stored with a special key format in the `student_grades` dictionary:
```python
student_grades[student_id]['group_{group_assignment_id}'] = {
    'grade': score,
    'comments': comments,
    'graded_at': timestamp,
    'type': 'group',
    'group_name': group_name
}
```

This distinguishes group assignments from individual assignments (which use just the assignment ID as the key).

### Grade Calculation
The average calculation now includes both individual and group assignment grades:
- Filters out 'N/A', 'Not Graded', and 'No Group' values
- Calculates average from all valid numeric grades
- Displays rounded to 2 decimal places

### Assignment Type Detection
In the template, assignment type is detected using:
```jinja2
{% if assignment.__class__.__name__ == 'GroupAssignment' %}
    {# Group assignment logic #}
{% else %}
    {# Individual assignment logic #}
{% endif %}
```

- Color-coded grade badges based on score

- Icon-based visual hierarchy

4. **Test view toggle**: Verify switching between table and card view maintains data
5. **Test grade calculations**: Verify averages include both individual and group grades
