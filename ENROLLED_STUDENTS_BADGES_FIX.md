# Enrolled Students Badges Fix Summary

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED: ENROLLED STUDENTS BADGES NOW DISPLAY TEXT**

Successfully fixed the missing text in the blue and yellow badges for enrolled students in the class overview page.

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

### **Problem:**
The "Enrolled Students" section in the class overview page (`view_class.html`) was showing empty blue and yellow boxes instead of displaying student ID and grade level information.

### **Technical Issue:**
The badges were using the same color for text and background, making text invisible:
```css
bg-info bg-opacity-20 text-info     /* Blue text on blue background */
bg-warning bg-opacity-20 text-warning /* Yellow text on yellow background */
```

This created nearly invisible text that appeared as solid colored boxes.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **CSS Color Fix:**
Changed the text colors from matching the background colors to dark for excellent contrast:

#### **Before (Invisible Text):**
```html
<!-- Student ID Badge -->
<span class="badge bg-info bg-opacity-20 text-info border border-info">
  ID: {{ student.student_id or 'N/A' }}
</span>

<!-- Grade Level Badge -->
<span class="badge bg-warning bg-opacity-20 text-warning border border-warning ms-1">
  Grade: {{ student.grade_level }}
</span>
```

#### **After (Visible Text):**
```html
<!-- Student ID Badge -->
<span class="badge bg-info bg-opacity-20 text-dark border border-info">
  ID: {{ student.student_id or 'N/A' }}
</span>

<!-- Grade Level Badge -->
<span class="badge bg-warning bg-opacity-20 text-dark border border-warning ms-1">
  Grade: {{ student.grade_level }}
</span>
```
