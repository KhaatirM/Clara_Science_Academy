## 🔍 **ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### **Issue 1: ID Text Not Visible in "Add Students to Class" Area**
- **Problem**: Student ID badges were using blue text on blue background (`text-info` on `bg-info`)
- **Solution**: Changed to dark text on blue background (`text-dark` on `bg-info`)
- **Result**: Student IDs now clearly visible as "ID: ST001", "ID: ST002", etc.

### **Issue 2: Missing Teacher Information in "Assigned Teachers" Section**
- **Problem**: Teacher names and roles were invisible due to color contrast issues
- **Solution**: Fixed text colors for all teacher badges:
  - Primary teacher: Dark text on green background
  - Substitute teachers: Dark text on yellow background  
  - Additional teachers: Dark text on blue background
- **Result**: All teacher information now clearly visible

### **Issue 3: Section Title Update Request**
- **Problem**: User requested title change from "Teacher Assignments" to "Assigned Teachers"
