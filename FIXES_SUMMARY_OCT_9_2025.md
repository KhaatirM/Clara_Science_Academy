# Fixes Summary - October 9, 2025

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Student Deletion Error - Cleaning Team Member**
**Error**: `null value in column "student_id" of relation "cleaning_team_member" violates not-null constraint`

**Fix**: Updated `managementroutes.py` `remove_student()` function to delete `CleaningTeamMember` records before deleting the student.

**Files Modified**:
- `managementroutes.py` (lines 5056-5061, 5104-5105)

**Changes**:
```python
# Added CleaningTeamMember to imports
from models import (..., CleaningTeamMember)

# Added deletion of cleaning team memberships
CleaningTeamMember.query.filter_by(student_id=student_id).delete()
```

---

### 2. **Student Dashboard DateTime Comparison Error**
**Error**: `'<' not supported between instances of 'datetime.date' and 'datetime.datetime'`

**Fix**: Updated `studentroutes.py` to ensure both date objects are of the same type before comparison.

**Files Modified**:
- `studentroutes.py` (lines 295-306)

**Changes**:
```python
# Added conversion to ensure both are date objects
due_date = assignment.due_date.date() if hasattr(assignment.due_date, 'date') else assignment.due_date
today_date = today.date() if hasattr(today, 'date') else today
if due_date < today_date:
    past_due_assignments.append(assignment)
```

### 3. **Resources Tab Access Control**
**Issue**: Needed to verify that Resources tab is only accessible to Teachers, School Administrators, and Directors (not students).

**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Resources tab is correctly restricted in `templates/shared/dashboard_layout.html`:
- Directors: Line 55
- School Administrators: Line 71
- Teachers: Line 85
- IT Support: Line 111
- **Students: NO ACCESS** (confirmed lines 91-99)

### 6. **Calendar Access for Teachers Fixed**
**Issue**: Teachers with roles like "Math Teacher", "Science Teacher", etc. were getting 403 errors when navigating calendar months because the template was checking for exact role match `== 'Teacher'`.

**Fix**: Updated `templates/shared/calendar.html` to use `'Teacher' in current_user.role` instead of exact match.

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/shared/calendar.html` (lines 20, 30)

**Changes**:
```python
# Before
{% if current_user.role == 'Teacher' %}

# After  
{% if 'Teacher' in current_user.role %}
```

---

### 7. **Calendar Legend Color Consistency Fixed**
**Issue**: Calendar legend colors didn't match the actual calendar day colors because:
1. Template was using `event.category` (human-readable like "Quarter", "Semester") to generate CSS classes
2. Should have been using `event.type` (CSS-friendly like "academic_period_start", "teacher_work_day")

**Fix**: 
1. Updated template to use `event.type` instead of `event.category`
2. Added CSS classes for all event types
3. Updated legend to show correct event types with matching colors

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/shared/calendar.html` (lines 110, 147-180)
- `static/style.css` (lines 1522-1605)

**Color Mapping**:
- **Quarter/Semester Start** (academic_period_start): Green (#28a745)
- **Quarter/Semester End** (academic_period_end): Red (#dc3545)
- **Teacher Work Day** (teacher_work_day): Orange (#fd7e14)
- **School Break Start** (school_break_start): Pink (#e83e8c)
- **School Break End** (school_break_end): Purple (#6f42c1)
- **Other Events** (calendar_event): Blue (#007bff)
