2. **Roster page showing wrong data** ✅ IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Issue 1: Grades Page Completely Blank**
- **Problem**: Grades page was rendering blank white page
- **Root Cause**: Template inheritance issue - `class_grades.html` was using `{% block content %}` but `dashboard_layout.html` uses `{% block dashboard_content %}`
- **Impact**: Template content wasn't being rendered, showing only base layout

### **Issue 2: Roster Page Data Inconsistency**
- **Problem**: Roster page shows "Introduction to Physics" with 0 students, but class overview shows 10 students
- **Root Cause**: Class ID mismatch - different classes being displayed
  - **Class ID 2**: "Advanced Mathematics 8" - 5 enrolled students
  - **Class ID 6**: "Introduction to Physics" - 10 enrolled students
- **Impact**: Users see inconsistent information between class overview and roster pages
