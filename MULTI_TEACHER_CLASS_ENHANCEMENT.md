class_obj.additional_teachers.clear()

# Add substitute teachers
substitute_teacher_ids = request.form.getlist('substitute_teachers')
for teacher_id in substitute_teacher_ids:
    if teacher_id:
        teacher = TeacherStaff.query.get(int(teacher_id))
        if teacher:
            class_obj.substitute_teachers.append(teacher)

# Add additional teachers
additional_teacher_ids = request.form.getlist('additional_teachers')
for teacher_id in additional_teacher_ids:
    if teacher_id:
        teacher = TeacherStaff.query.get(int(teacher_id))
        if teacher:
            class_obj.additional_teachers.append(teacher)
```

#### **Add Class Route (`add_class`):**
```python
# Handle multi-teacher assignments
# Add substitute teachers
substitute_teacher_ids = request.form.getlist('substitute_teachers')
for teacher_id in substitute_teacher_ids:
    if teacher_id:
        teacher = TeacherStaff.query.get(int(teacher_id))
        if teacher:
            new_class.substitute_teachers.append(teacher)

# Add additional teachers
additional_teacher_ids = request.form.getlist('additional_teachers')
for teacher_id in additional_teacher_ids:
    if teacher_id:
        teacher = TeacherStaff.query.get(int(teacher_id))
        if teacher:
            new_class.additional_teachers.append(teacher)
