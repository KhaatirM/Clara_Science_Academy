# Password Management Scripts

These scripts allow you to see user passwords by resetting them to known values. Since original passwords are stored as hashes and cannot be recovered, these scripts set new passwords that you can see.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Same Password for All Users (Fastest)
```bash
python reset_and_show_passwords.py
```
**Result**: All users get password `password123`

### Option 2: Individual Passwords (Recommended)
```bash
python quick_individual_passwords.py
```
**Result**: Each user gets password `username123` (e.g., `admin123`, `teacher123`)

## üìã Available Scripts

### 1. `reset_and_show_passwords.py` - Same Password for All
**Purpose**: Reset all users to the same password
**Usage**: `python reset_and_show_passwords.py`
**Result**: All users get password `password123`

### 2. `quick_individual_passwords.py` - Individual Passwords (Recommended)
**Purpose**: Give each user a unique password

### 4. `individual_passwords.py` - Individual Passwords with Confirmation

## üìä Output Examples

### Individual Passwords Output:
```
================================================================================
USER CREDENTIALS WITH INDIVIDUAL PASSWORDS
================================================================================
Password format: username + '123'
================================================================================
ID: 1 | Username: admin | Password: admin123 | Role: Director
ID: 2 | Username: teacher1 | Password: teacher1123 | Role: Teacher
ID: 3 | Username: student1 | Password: student1123 | Role: Student

Total: 3 users - All passwords reset to username + '123'
```

### Same Password Output:

================================================================================
USER CREDENTIALS WITH VISIBLE PASSWORDS
================================================================================
All users now have password: password123
================================================================================
ID: 1 | Username: admin | Password: password123 | Role: Director
ID: 2 | Username: teacher1 | Password: password123 | Role: Teacher

```

## üîí Security Notes

### Important Security Considerations:
1. **Password Reset**: These scripts reset ALL user passwords
2. **Known Passwords**: After running, you'll know all user passwords
3. **Temporary Access**: Use these passwords to access accounts, then change them
4. **Secure Handling**: Treat the output as sensitive information

### Recommended Workflow:
1. **Run Script**: Use `quick_individual_passwords.py` to set known passwords
2. **Access Accounts**: Use the displayed passwords to log in
3. **Change Passwords**: Change passwords to secure values through the web interface
4. **Clean Up**: Delete any temporary files created

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import Error**: 
   ```
   Error importing modules: No module named 'app'
   ```
   **Solution**: Make sure you're in the project root directory (`/opt/render/project/src`)

2. **Database Connection Error**:
   ```
   Error: Database connection failed
   ```
   **Solution**: Check that your database is running and accessible

3. **Permission Denied**:
   ```
   Permission denied: cannot open file
   ```
   **Solution**: The script doesn't need to create files for basic password reset

### Getting Help:
```bash
python password_manager.py help
```
