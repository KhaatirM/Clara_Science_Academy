# Substitute and Additional Teachers Display Fix

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED: SUBSTITUTE AND ADDITIONAL TEACHERS TEXT NOW VISIBLE**

Successfully fixed the final visibility issue with the "Substitute Teachers" and "Additional Teachers" sections in the class roster management page.

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

### **Problem:**
The "N/A" and "None assigned" text in the substitute and additional teachers sections were invisible due to poor color contrast.

### **Technical Issue:**
The badges were using secondary text color on secondary background:
```css
bg-secondary bg-opacity-20 text-secondary
```
- `bg-secondary` = Gray background
- `bg-opacity-20` = 20% opacity (making it light gray)
- `text-secondary` = Gray text

This created gray text on gray background, making the text nearly invisible.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **CSS Color Fix:**
Changed the text color from gray to dark for better visibility:

#### **Before (Invisible Text):**
```html
<!-- Substitute Teachers N/A -->
<span class="badge bg-secondary bg-opacity-20 text-secondary border border-secondary">
    N/A
</span>

<!-- Additional Teachers None assigned -->
<span class="badge bg-secondary bg-opacity-20 text-secondary border border-secondary">
    None assigned
</span>
```

#### **After (Visible Text):**
```html
<!-- Substitute Teachers N/A -->
<span class="badge bg-secondary bg-opacity-20 text-dark border border-secondary">
    N/A
</span>

<!-- Additional Teachers None assigned -->
<span class="badge bg-secondary bg-opacity-20 text-dark border border-secondary">
    None assigned
</span>
```

## 📊 **VERIFICATION RESULTS**

### **Template Rendering Tests:**
```
✅ Substitute teachers N/A text - Found: N/A
✅ Additional teachers None assigned text - Found: None assigned
✅ Secondary badge with dark text - Found: bg-secondary bg-opacity-20 text-dark
```

### **Database Status Confirmed:**
```
✅ Physics class: Introduction to Physics
✅ Primary teacher: Lisa Williams (visible)
✅ Substitute teachers: 0 assigned (now shows "N/A" clearly)
✅ Additional teachers: 0 assigned (now shows "None assigned" clearly)
```
